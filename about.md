This is my personal blog where I'll be posting some random stuff about machine learning and data science. I'm currently finishing up my MsC in Engineering Mathematics at Chalmers University of Technology where I've been focusing on ML and optimization. 

## About the name
I think the best way to communicate what ML-algos *does* and the kind of output they produce is to focus on the problem they're supposed to solve. This problem is solely defined by the loss/objective function which we are minimizing. Sometimes we can even make up probabilistic tales that will help us understand the kind of trade-offs that the objective function (log-likelihood) induces. I like this perspective, seeing machine learning as mathematical optimization sparkled with probablistic stories. I also think it's a good modeling-habit. Hence I'll try to *focus on the objective*.
