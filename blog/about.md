ML algos are just like any other piece of complex technology. 

I think the best way to communicate what ML-algos *does* and the kind of output they produce is to focus on the problem they're supposed to solve. This problem is solely defined by the loss function which we are minimizing. 

Sometimes (when we are optimizing log-loss) we can even make up probabilistic tales that will help us understand the kind of trade-offs that the objective function induces. 

* Objective functions and data munging
* Objective functions will lead you to good modeling-habits
	- What's your population/probability space? 
	- How are terms in the objective function related/weighted?
	- Generalized view, modularity, etc. 

* Objective function and basic probability is needed to. compare home lasik
